# transport-JAVA-course-1
This Git repository contains a Java implementation of a simple class hierarchy. Within this project, you'll find various Java classes organized in a hierarchical structure. These classes are designed to illustrate fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

practice-1:
Create a class hierarchy. Topic for your hierarchy will be provided by your mentors.
Requirements:
- At least 10 classes
- All classes must contain properties (minimum 1)
- At least 5 private properties (in total, in any classes)
- All private variables must have getters and setters.
- All classes should have at least one custom constructor
- Create separate class with main() which will instantiate objects of implemented classes.

practice-2:
Extended your previous homework with next features:
Requirements:
- Use polymorphism with at least one abstract class.
- Create and override at least one abstract method.
- Use protected modifier at least 5 times
- Override methods from class Object (toString(), hashcode(), equals()) for at least 3 classes from the hierarchy.

practice-3:
- Add 5 interfaces to the existing hierarchy.
- Use polymorphism with the abstract class and interface from the hierarchy.
- Create final class, method, variable. 
- Create a static block, method, variable.

practice-4:
- Create 5 custom exceptions.
- Handle exceptions in 2 ways. 
- Use try-catch with resources.
- Log messages to the console, file.

practice-5:
- Add 5 collections to the hierarchy. 
- Create custom LinkedList with generic.

practice-6:
- Move all projects to Maven. 
- Build jar file and deploy to the local repository. 
- Add 2 Plugins.
- Run mvn for different phases from the Maven lifecycle. Check the result.

practice-7:
- generate a conflict
- make a pr with branches
- make a pr with forks

practice-8:
- Read text from the file and calculate the numbers of the unique words. 
- Write the result to the file. 
- The main requirement is: using StringUtils and FileUtils to implement it with minimum lines of code.

practice-9:
- Use at least 5 lambda functions from the java.util.function package.
- Create 3 custom Lambda functions with generics.
- Create 5 complex Enums(with fields, methods, blocks).

practice-10:
- Add 7 collection streaming in the hierarchy with terminal and non-terminal operations.
- Using reflection extract information(modifiers, return types, parameters, etc) about fields, constructors, methods. Create object and call method using the only reflection.

practice-11:
- Create 2 Threads using Runnable and Thread.

- Create Connection Pool. 
- Use collection from java.util.concurrent package. 
- Connection class may be mocked. 
- The pool should be threadsafe and lazy initialized. 

- Initialize pool with 5 sizes. 
- Load Connection Pool using threads and Thread Pool(7 threads). 
- 5 threads should be able to get the connection. 
- 2 Threads should wait for the next available connection. 
- The program should wait as well.

- Implement 4th part but with IFuture and CompletableStage.
